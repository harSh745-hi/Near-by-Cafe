## Project Description

The find nearby Cafe's app is an interactive web application built using React and React Leaflet. It displays the user’s current location and nearby cafés in the Swargate area. Café data is read from a static JSON file, and users can click on a café in the sidebar to zoom to its location on the map. This project demonstrates state management, map integration, and dynamic UI updates.
